    Name: Ruth

    Transcript: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get
                into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.
                If you have security footage from the courthouse parking
                lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking
                lot in that time frame.

    Name: Eugene
    id: 162
    Transcript: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
                Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse,
                I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief
                there withdrawing some money.

    Name: Raymond
    id: 163
    Transcript: As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone
                who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
                I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the
                earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then
                asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase
                the flight ticket.
