            A quick way to build a sequence is using a list comprehension (if the target is a list)
            or a generator expression (for all other kinds of sequences). If you are not using these
            syntactic forms on a daily basis, I bet you are missing opportunities to write code that
            is more readable and often faster at the same time.

            If you doubt my claim that these constructs are “more readable,” read on. I’ll try to
            convince you.
