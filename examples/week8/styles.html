            <p>
                Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software
                is even harder. You must find pertinent objects, factor them into classes at the
                right granularity, define class interfaces and inheritance hierarchies, and establish key
                relationships among them. Your design should be specific to the problem at hand but
                also general enough to address future problems and requirements. Youalso want to
                avoid redesign, or at least minimize it. Experienced object-oriented designers will tell
                you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult ifnot impossible to get "right" the first
                time. Before a design is finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it
                each time.

            <h2 class = "header2">1.1 What is a Design Pattern?</h2>
            <p>
                Christopher Alexander says, "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and
                over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
                problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
                doing it the same way twice" [AIS+77, page x}. Even though Alexander was talking
                about patterns inbuildings and towns, what he saysistrue about object-oriented design
                patterns. Our solutions are expressed in terms of objects and interfaces instead of walls
                and doors, but at the core of both kinds of patterns is a solution to a problem in a
                context.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The pattern name is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions,
                        and consequences in a word or two. Naming a pattern immediately
                        increases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction.
                        Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us talk about them with our colleagues,
                        in our documentation, and even to ourselves. It makes it easier to think about
                        designs and to communicate them and their trade-offs to others. Finding good
                        names has been one of the hardest parts of developing our catalog.

                        Theproblem describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its
                        context. It might describe specific design problems such as how to represent algorithms
                        as objects. It might describe class or object structures that are symptomatic
                        of an inflexible design. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions
                        that must be met before it makes sense to apply the pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thesolution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships,
                        responsibilities, and collaborations. The solution doesn't describe a particular
                        concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can
                        be applied in many different situations. Instead, the pattern provides an abstract
                        description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements
                        (classes and objectsin our case) solves it.

                        Theconsequences are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.Though
                        consequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions, they are
                        critical for evaluating design alternatives and for understanding the costs and
                        benefits of applying the pattern.
                        The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs. They
                        may address language and implementation issues as well. Since reuse is often a
                        factor in object-oriented design, the consequences of a pattern include its impact
                        on a system'sflexibility, extensibility, or portability. Listing these consequences
                        explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them.
